Bolt's record-breaking performances in the 100m and 200m events, coupled with his celebratory poses, have made him a global sensation and a true Olympic icon.</p><h2>Nadia Comaneci: Perfect 10</h2><p>Gymnastics prodigy Nadia Comaneci achieved the impossible at the 1976 Montreal Olympics by scoring the first perfect 10 in the history of the sport. The Romanian gymnast captivated the world with her flawless routines and graceful execution, setting a new standard of excellence in women's gymnastics.</p><h2>Michael Phelps: The Swimming Legend</h2><p>Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, redefined the sport of swimming with his unparalleled success. The American swimmer's record-breaking medal haul of 23 golds and 28 overall medals is a testament to his extraordinary talent, dedication, and relentless pursuit of greatness.</p><h2>Wilma Rudolph: Triumph Over Adversity</h2><p>Wilma Rudolph overcame significant challenges to become an Olympic champion. The African-American sprinter defied polio and childhood illnesses to win three gold medals at the 1960 Rome Olympics, becoming a symbol of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity.</p><h2>Simone Biles: The Queen of Gymnastics</h2><p>Simone Biles has dominated women's gymnastics with her unparalleled skills and daring routines. The American gymnast's gravity-defying performances and unwavering confidence have earned her multiple Olympic gold medals and solidified her status as one of the greatest gymnasts of all time.</p><h2>Carl Lewis: Track and Field Legend</h2><p>Carl Lewis, often referred to as the 'Olympian of the Century', left an indelible mark on the world of track and field. The American sprinter and long jumper won a total of nine Olympic gold medals and set numerous world records, showcasing his exceptional talent and versatility in multiple events.</p><h2>Conclusion: A Legacy of Inspiration</h2><p>From Jesse Owens' defiance of discrimination to Usain Bolt's electrifying speed, Olympic history is rich with stories of triumph, perseverance, and sheer determination.
